"""Test ratchet: the suite may grow, it must not shrink.

The gate runs the suite and compares it with verification/test_inventory.json: every recorded test
must still exist, and every skipped test must be on the recorded list of allowed skips, each with
its reason. Deleting a test, or skipping one that was not skipped before, fails this gate even when
every remaining test passes, which is exactly how a coding agent under pressure turns a red suite
green. Tests and skips are tracked by id, not by count: a deleted test replaced by a trivial one
keeps the count, and a skip can depend on the platform.

After adding tests or a deliberate skip, update the inventory in the same commit with `--update`:
it records the current tests and adds the current skips to the allowed list (it never removes an
allowed skip).
